HackerRank challenges solution
===============================
Here i will post solution for HackerRank challenges, python files names are same as names of challenges


Python exercise are very short, so i don't want put one where one short magical phrase are enough, maybe i will

Each of exercise will be stand alone python file

In docstring i put sample input and sample out of first test case on HackerRank, if input is more complex
than one string that go to logic, i will use ``with open("txt file with input", 'r') as f: f.readline()`` so there
will be text file with name ``ExerciseNameinput`` with whole input from test case
