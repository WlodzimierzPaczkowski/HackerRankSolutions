HackerRank challenges solution
===============================

folder for each language 

They aren't numerated like on HackerRank, i just put here one that are from around medium difficulty, and where i could write some more code than one line, or at least one easy line

This project is part of my mastering of programing, while doing those exercises and later timed challenges on hacker rank site i can learn solving problems in practice, most importantly this is road map for me

Based on part where i lack i search documentation, watch or read tutorials and create small "note programs"(Like notes in notebook but by hitting run they execute code) of using certain concepts

Whole project will be full of comments where i try to explain everything

README.rst is best way to navigate in this project
